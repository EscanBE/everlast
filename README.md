### EverLast
Make the EVM-enabled blockchain great again:
- Since Evmos made the Evmos repo licensed, we forked it to develop it up.
- Healthy of Evmos chain is very low right now so we capture balance of users to EverLast and let users able to move to EverLast. The balance will be reduced by some deduction factor to prevent massive tokens owned by the previous foundation members.
- Totally fair launch, community driven.

EverLast builds on top of Evmos v12.1.6, and adds a lot of magic to it.
EverLast support [stateful precompiled contracts](https://github.com/EscanBE/evermint/pull/175) in a real way to allow expanding to all Cosmos-SDK modules.
